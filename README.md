# zveno-site

Marketing site for Zveno, the desktop app that runs a team of AI coding agents.

Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript) and Tailwind CSS 4. One page, light and dark themes, built to look like the app itself: liquid-glass panels, Geist and Geist Mono, theme tokens from `SPEC.md` §4.3 of the Zveno repo, and the agent mascots ported from the prototype.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
```

## Where things are

- `src/app/globals.css`: theme tokens (light / dark), glass utilities, mascot keyframes.
- `src/components/sections/`: one file per slide, in order: Cover, HowItWorks, Product (screenshot slideshow with floating popups), Bento (the "more tools" card carousel), Skills, Providers, Security, Download; Footer sits at the bottom of the last slide.
- `src/components/Deck.tsx`: the presentation controller. Each section is one 100svh slide on desktop (width >= 768 and height >= 600, no reduced motion). One wheel gesture, PageUp/PageDown, Space or arrow moves one slide with a 700ms eased scroll; anchors jump to their slide. Content that does not fit is scaled down. Phones, short windows and reduced motion scroll normally.
- `src/components/Autoplay.tsx`: autoplay for the carousels and `StoryBars`, the segmented progress under them (pauses on hover, focus, hidden tab and off-screen; off under reduced motion).
- `src/components/Bug.tsx`: the agent mascot, a port of `bugEl()` from `design/Zveno.dc.html`.
- `src/lib/site.ts`: download link, nav links, quotes. Set `DOWNLOAD.windows` to the installer URL when the first public build is out.
- `public/shots/`: screenshots of the Zveno prototype, `light-*` and `dark-*` for each screen. The page shows the one that matches the theme.
- `RESEARCH.md`: what was borrowed from other product sites, and why.

## Updating screenshots

The screenshots come from the HTML prototype in the Zveno repo (`design/Zveno.dc.html`), captured at 1440×900 with a device scale of 2 and saved as WebP. When the app's look changes, capture the same screens again in both themes and replace the files with the same names.
